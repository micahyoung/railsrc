# Hybrid railsrc / rails app template

## What is this?

This is my hybrid railsrc and app template, including several of my preferred defaults.

## Instructions

Just move/symlink this to ~/.railsrc and modify.

## Why?

I, like most devs, have a sensible set of defaults for my projects. `rails new` restricts some options to the rc file (or command-line), while some options are only available from a templates. This hacks around that by putting both in one place.
